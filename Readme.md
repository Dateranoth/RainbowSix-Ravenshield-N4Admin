This patch fixes incorrect stats being posted by the server.

Just add the extra files in the "Server" folder to your server's main ravenshield directory.

=============

Not from Repository Owner: I'm just hosting this here because I'm not sure how much longer the game will be around but the resources for RavenShield are definitely dwindeling so finding cool stuff like the N4Admin/Stats programs are becoming more difficult. If the original authors of these files want this repo taken down just send me an email. admin at ericnkatz.com
